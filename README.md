# The-Fruit-Rage game implemented using minimax algorthim with alpha beta pruning

The	Fruit	Rage	is	a	two	player	game	in	which	each	player	tries	to	maximize	his/her	share	from	a	
batch of	fruits randomly	placed	in	a	box.	The	box	is	divided	into	cells	and	each	cell	is	either	empty	
or	filled	with	one	fruit	of	a	specific	type.

At	the	beginning	of	each	game,	all	cells	are	filled	with	fruits.	Players	play	in	turn	and	can	pick	a	
cell	of	the	box	in	their	own	turn	and	claim	all	fruit	of	the	same	type,	in	all	cells	that	are	connected	
to	the	selected	cell	through	horizontal	and	vertical	paths.	For	each	selection	or	move	the	agent	
is	rewarded	a	numeric	value	which	is	the	square	of	the	number	of	fruits	claimed	in	that	move.	
Once	an	agent	picks	the	fruits	from	the	cells,	their	empty	place	will	be	filled	with	other	fruits	on	
top	of	them (which	fall	down	due	to	gravity),	if	any. In	this game,	no	fruit	is	added	during	game	
play.	Hence,	players	play	until	all	fruits	have	been	claimed.

Another	big	constraint	of	this	game	is	that	every	agent	has	a	limited	amount	of	time	to	spend	for	
thinking	during	the	whole	game.	Spending	more	than	the	original	allocated	time	will	be	penalized	
harshly. Each	player	is	allocated	a	fixed	total	amount	of	time.	When	it	is	your	turn	to	play,	you	
will	also	be	told	how	much	remaining	time	you	have.	The	time	you	take	on	each	move	will	be	
subtracted	from	your	total	remaining	time.	If	your	remaining	time	reaches	zero,	your	agent	will	
automatically	lose	the	game.

The	 overall	 score	 of	 each	 player	 is the	 sum	 of	 rewards	 gained	 for	 every	 turn.	 The	 game	 will	
terminate	when	there	is	no	fruit	left	in	the	box or	when	a	player	has	run	out	of	time.	

# Input: 

### The	file	input.txt in the	current	directory	of the program	will	is formatted	as	follows:

First	line:	 integer	n,	the	width	and	height	of	the	square	board (0	<	n	< 26)<br>
Second	line:	 integer p,	the	number	of	fruit	types	(0	<	p	< 9)<br>
Third line:	 strictly	positive	floating	point	number,	your	remaining	time	in	seconds<br>
Next	n	lines:	 the	n	x	n	board,	with	one	board	row	per	input	file	line,	and	n	characters	(plus	endof-line
marker)	on	each	line.	Each	character	can	be	either	a	digit	from	0	to	p-1,	or	
a	*	to	denote	an	empty	cell.

# Output:	

### The	file	output.txt which the	program	creates	in the	current	directory	is formatted	as	follows:

First	line:	 your	selected	move,	represented	as	two	characters:	
A	letter from	A	 to	Z	 representing	 the	column	number	 (where	A	is	 the	leftmost	
column,	B	is	the	next	one	to	the	right,	etc), and
A	number from	1	to	26	representing	the	row	number	(where	1	is	the	top	row,	2	is	
the	row	below	it,	etc).<br>
Next	n	lines:	 the	n	x	n	board	just	after	your	move	and	after	gravity	has	been	applied	to	make	
any	 fruits	 fall	into	 holes	 created	 by	your	move	 taking	away	 some	 fruits.
